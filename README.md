## ðŸŒŸ Overview

Vale solves the liquidity problem for staked ETH:
- Borrow against your Validator NFT without interest
- Get immediate liquidity without unstaking
- Earn staking rewards as a lender
- Protection against slashing risks

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

**For Borrowers:**
- Deposit your Validator NFT as collateral
- Borrow up to 84% of its value in USDC (e.g., 27 ETH worth for a 32 ETH NFT)
- Repay the same amount to get your NFT back

**For Lenders:**
- Deposit funds into the ERC4626 vault
- Receive tokens representing your pool share
- Earn a portion of staking rewards from NFTs
